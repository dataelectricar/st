							<h3>Commissions and Costs of uses</h3>
							<p>One of the first things that we have noticed when using the skrill platform are the commissions, we have compared them with companies in the same industry and we have come to the conclusion that the costs for using the main services of the platform can be very striking if we compare them with the rest of the competitors in the same field, likewise we see that the commissions that the platform charges for its use are relatively very low cost as we have been able to see not only in the current percentage but also in the percentage that we can take with respect to previous years since the beginning of his career.</p>

							<h3>Functionalities and uses of the service</h3>
							<p>We have studied the main functions as well as the structure of your website to determine as objectively as possible if they adapt to a functional and modern architecture or if, on the contrary, your architecture is out of modernism and its outdated functions, we have arrived at the conclusion that presents a very modern system and additional functions to the basic functions, so we can conclude that it presents very high performance functions and a modern, functional and beautiful structure that keeps it at the forefront of new technological advances.</p>

							<h3>Affiliate Program</h3>
							<p>Skrill has an affiliate program that offers very good commissions, it should be noted that in contrast to other platforms that offer very low incentives in their affiliate programs while others do not, Skrill maintains a good incentive for its affiliate program which which makes it a great option if you want to generate extra money on the platform.</p>
